# Apedik_PasswordAttributes module

This Magento module adds password attributes to `<input type"password">` element, eg:

```<input type"password" minlength="8" pattern="[0-9A-Z]"  autocomplete="new-password" >```

This is very useful for password managers and browsers to suggest the right password based on password requirements in Magento Password Options and, hopefully, improving conversions too.
